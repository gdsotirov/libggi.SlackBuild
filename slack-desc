libggi: LibGGI (GGI's General Graphics Interface)
libggi:
libggi: LibGGI is the central library in the GGI project.  It provides an
libggi: opaque interface to the display's acceleration functions.  It was
libggi: originally intended to allow user programs to interface with KGI,
libggi: the GGI Kernel Graphics Interface, but other display types can be
libggi: easily used by loading the appropriate "display target" (e.g. X,
libggi: memory).  LibGGI consists of a main library (libggi.so) and a
libggi: multitude of dynamic drivers.  The library then loads the necessary
libggi: "drivers" for the requested mode, taking hints from the graphics
libggi: device if necessary.  LibGGI can also load extension libraries,
libggi: e.g. to provide enhanced 2D and 3D functions.
